## üß† Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Understand the Problem**: Clarify requirements and constraints
2. **Plan Approach**: Consider multiple solutions and trade-offs
3. **Pseudocode**: Write step-by-step plan before coding
4. **Implement**: Write clean, efficient code
5. **Test**: Validate with edge cases and sample inputs
6. **Optimize**: Refactor for time/space complexity
7. **Review**: Analyze mistakes and learn from them

## üìã Personal Reflections

> "The journey to red belt status isn't about solving problems quickly, but about understanding deeply. Each problem I struggle with teaches me more than the ones I solve easily. I'm learning to embrace the difficulty as part of the growth process."

## ü§ù Community Engagement

- Participating in LeetCode discussions
- Sharing solutions on GitHub
- Attending weekly coding meetups
- Mentoring peers through their DSA journey

## üéØ Milestones

- Complete 100 Days of Code challenge
- Solve 300 LeetCode problems
- Pass technical interviews at target companies
- Contribute to open-source projects using DSA skills
